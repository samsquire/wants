What do I want?

# Digital contracts

An app whereby you can see a contract and how it breaks down what you've agreed to, what you're not allowed to do and what your available actions available to you that you're allowed to do from the contract's perspective. And your obligations.
Public spaces broadcast contracts and your phone picks them up.

I can open my phone in the cinema and see all the copyrights agreements I've agreed to by being there. NO RECORDING it would clearly say.

I would see my phone contract and have a button for 'Upgrade phone'.

# Work ports and Free flowing work

Get vetted by a single job interview
Imagine train stations were shopping centres, offices and residential tall buildings all rolled into one. I call them work ports.
Free flowing works means this: Imagine there was a company, WorkExcelsior that offers job interviews as a service, you get approved by this interview company, you can get a job at any of the companies that use that interview company. Once vetted by WorkExcelsior, I can get a job by looking at the window of a shop to see if they accept this accreditation. I don't have to pass a job interview. I can apply by app and get a job in minutes.

Then I can go to work at my local train station. If my company doesn't have offices at the local train station, I can jump on the WorkExcelsior train and be taken to a nearby city with offices for my company. Accreditation companies take the place of recruiters and premium accreditation companies are actually in demand. They sponsor commuting costs, as you get buses, trains, taxis branded with each accreditation company.

# Active slides

Manage a company by presentation

Companies that manage themselves via presentation slides (such as Powerpoint) could be doing it with active slides. Active slides change dynamically, in real time and talk via APIs to other systems.
The slide presentation editor software has a app style shop to find integrations that you can talk to backend systems such as ERP, payroll, sales data.
