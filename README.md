What do I want?

# Utopia on earth

The world becomes a good place to live. Everyone is doing what they want to do providing it is good things they want to do. People are doing work they enjoy and have a high standard of life. Everyone has money and money as an abstraction is used to provide all the benefits of a production signal. I'm not arguing for decadence, but a grateful society that is grateful for what it has. Everyone should be happy. Nobody should be desperate. Nobody should be forced into doing things they secretly do not want to do or secretly believe is not necessary.

* feeding people
* raising tighly knit high trust good quality no crime resilient communities
* producing things that people want or need

# Benefits

 * schools
 * higher education for vocational subjects - degrees where you can get a easily get a job
 * healthcare
 * cheap shelter

# Mall living

I would like to live above a shopping mall. Every thing is on my doorstep and there are plenty of activities in the mall to take part in. I have restaurants to eat from and entertainment.

# Crowdfunded restaurants

Restaurants crowd funded by people who want to eat at the restaurants. I would happily pay the costs of a restaurant divided by a bunch of people or so people who all want to eat at the same restaurant.

# Night offices

Offices to be useable at night time.

# Economic abstractions

Your typical layperson off the street cannot manage his pension and various insurances.

# Digital contracts

An app whereby you can see a contract and how it breaks down what you've agreed to, what you're not allowed to do and what your available actions available to you that you're allowed to do from the contract's perspective. And your obligations.
Public spaces broadcast contracts and your phone picks them up.

I can open my phone in the cinema and see all the copyrights agreements I've agreed to by being there. NO RECORDING it would clearly say.

I would see my phone contract and have a button for 'Upgrade phone'.

# Work ports and Free flowing work

Get vetted by a single job interview
Imagine train stations were shopping centres, offices and residential tall buildings all rolled into one. I call them work ports.
Free flowing works means this: Imagine there was a company, WorkExcelsior that offers job interviews as a service, you get approved by this interview company, you can get a job at any of the companies that use that interview company. Once vetted by WorkExcelsior, I can get a job by looking at the window of a shop to see if they accept this accreditation. I don't have to pass a job interview. I can apply by app and get a job in minutes.

Then I can go to work at my local train station. If my company doesn't have offices at the local train station, I can jump on the WorkExcelsior train and be taken to a nearby city with offices for my company. Accreditation companies take the place of recruiters and premium accreditation companies are actually in demand. They sponsor commuting costs, as you get buses, trains, taxis branded with each accreditation company.

# Conversational development/forum based software development

Can software be developed collaboratively via a forum environment?

# Active slides

Manage a company by presentation

Companies that manage themselves via presentation slides (such as Powerpoint) could be doing it with active slides. Active slides change dynamically, in real time and talk via APIs to other systems.
The slide presentation editor software has a app style shop to find integrations that you can talk to backend systems such as ERP, payroll, sales data.

# Gig economy

Stabilised, commoditized recruitment, fair

# Shop Cartridges

Shop shelves could be loaded in a lorry and loaded into a building like a cartridge.

# Futuristic ideas

Futuristic ideas for cities: 3d cities, credit cards, linked strip malls, life subscriptions, life search engines

## Buildings linked by skyways

Skyscrapers in cities are linked together by skyways. Buildings are zoned based on levels, so levels 10-25 and 45-60 could be a hospital precinct. So that hospital facility straddles buildings. Buildings are zoned so that they have shops, commercial offices and living spaces. You live high up in an apartment, you walk downwards, upwards, north, east, south, west to get to nearby buildings. Skyscrapers have pedestrian indoor footpaths around the outside of the buildings that link between buildings regularly as you go up the skyscraper. Some buildings would have Road encscribed buildings so that vehicles can get up to higher floors of the skyscraper. Would have to lay out the buildings and pathways so that light can get to everyone.

## Credit cards reimagination

What credit cards are meant to be - Credit cards are loaded with credit for branded things that you need to live on.
Life subscription - within your life you subscribe to different standards of living. This is a basket of things you have bought for your life. These are branded statements of life that you can buy. You go through a life search engine and find things you want in your life and pick them out of a catalogue. A placement company assigns you to positions within society to take, to get what you want. Each job, job title, salary is linked to every item in the life subscription. So you you can only pick what you can afford given your job. If you pick some thing out of your reach, you are told what you must do to get career progression to get what you want in the life catalogues.
I eat at a midtier restaurant once every two weeks = gets you a free meal and a table in that midtier restaurant brand restaurants. I buy a coffee everyday on the way to work. I travel to work by car/public transport. I drive this kind of car. I live in the suburbs. Or I live in the city centre. I drink this brand coffee. My job title is a X at Y. This means I can afford these things. I live in this kind of house. You can go into a shop and since you've subscribed to that brand coffee, you get it without doing a sale, as you've bought it from life credit.

## Rewards and perks

You earn credit with different companies, from adverts, promotions and sticking to the same brand. Advertisements become instant purchases of credit. Corporate welfare, business perks are outsourced to placement companies that serve the public. Everyone can buy and enjoy corporate benefits.
Strip malls are good - if connected by high speed rail and fast road systems. And have skyscrapers above them. People commute to strip malls to get to work. If you do not work in that particular strip mall, you still have good parking near local shops and good links to other offices.

## Virtual Borders

Society learns that borders delineate acceptability. It's what a neighbourhood is. What is acceptable or what people like within a set of borders, block level, strip mall level, street level, floor level.
People bet on what they want, not what makes the most money and it becomes a form of voting which provides funding for said ideas for both sides. Betting forms the basis of rules that you have chosen to live by.
Parallel societies - societies can fragment by what is wanted by each neighbourhood. You can create a new neighbourhood by living in a place with a set of beliefs, a placement company would try place you near to people who believe the same things as you. Everyone gets what they want.

I want to be 15 minutes of work walking. I want to be 5 minutes away from local shops. I want to be within 10 minutes of doctors. I want to be around this kind of people. All this has a cost and a set of positions to take to get what I want.
